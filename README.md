# Course-Parser

This program parses the Lehigh University course website by making parallel HTTP requests to the course website, parsing the HTML, and aggregating the data. We add one dependency, scalaj, which allows us to easily make the POST requests to Lehigh's webpage. 

### Sample output:

Sample output is available in sampleoutput.txt. Currently the information the program parses is...

1. Course Registration Number
2. Course Name
3. Section Number
4. Course Title
5. Credits
6. Instructor
7. Meeting Times
